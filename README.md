# Asymetric Cryptography project
This project  contains three asymmetric cryptography system including RSA, El Gamal and the Elliptic Curve El Gamal as well as their digital signature schemes of the corresponding crypto system. max key size for RSA and El Gamal is 2048 bit while EC el gamal is 128 bit using the secp256k1 curve

## Implementation

```python
##run rsa cryptosystem
python3 rsa_and_sign.py  
##run el gamal cryptosystem
python3 elgamal_and_sign.py  
##run ec el gamal cryptosystem
python3 EllipticCurve/elliptic_curve_and_sign.py    
```
